## üîß Customization Guide

### Modifying Responses
Each template includes a `respondToClassification()` function where you can add your custom logic:

```javascript
function respondToClassification(prediction) {
    const className = prediction.className;
    const confidence = prediction.probability;
    
    // Add your custom responses here!
    switch(className.toLowerCase()) {
        case 'your_class_name':
            // Your custom code here
            break;
    }
}
```

### Styling
All templates use CSS custom properties for easy theming:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #your-color;
    --secondary-color: #your-color;
    /* Customize colors, fonts, spacing, etc. */
}
```

### Adding Features
- **Sound Effects**: Use p5.sound library
- **Particle Systems**: Create visual effects
- **Data Logging**: Track usage and accuracy
- **Multiple Models**: Combine different classifications

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Model not loading:**
- Check that the model URL is correct
- Ensure you've exported your model from Teachable Machine
- Verify internet connection

**Camera/Microphone not working:**
- Check browser permissions
- Try HTTPS instead of HTTP
- Ensure hardware is connected and working

**Poor classification accuracy:**
- Retrain with more diverse data
- Check lighting conditions (for image/pose)
- Reduce background noise (for audio)

**Performance issues:**
- Reduce canvas size
- Increase classification interval
- Close other browser tabs

### Getting Help
- Check the individual template README files
- Review browser console for error messages
- Test with the original Teachable Machine interface
- Search the [p5.js forum](https://discourse.processing.org/c/p5js) for similar issues
